        <br>
        <div class="snakeDescription">Solidus Snake, real name George Sears, was a former soldier, special operations agent, and U.S. President. He was one of the three clones of the "Greatest Warrior of the 20th Century," Big Boss, along with Solid Snake and Liquid Snake.
        <br><br>
        Born in 1972, George was the result of the secret government project "Les Enfants Terribles," designed to create the perfect soldier using the genes of Big Boss. He was the third clone created, and was not subjected to the genetic modifications that his brothers underwent.
        <br><br>
        Solidus Snake went on to have a successful career in the military and eventually became the President of the United States. However, his presidency was marred by controversy and he was eventually overthrown in a coup d'etat.
        <br><br>
        Solidus Snake later resurfaced as the leader of the terrorist organization, the Sons of Liberty, and plotted to use a new Metal Gear, the Arsenal Gear, to take over the world. He was ultimately defeated by Solid Snake in a final showdown.
