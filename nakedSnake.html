        <br>
        <div class="snakeDescription">Big Boss, real name John, was a former soldier, mercenary, and special operations agent. He was considered to be one of the greatest soldiers of the 20th century, and was known as the "Greatest Warrior of the 20th Century." He was also the founder and leader of the military state of Outer Heaven, and later the private military company, Diamond Dogs.
        <br><br>
        Big Boss was born in 1935 and joined the military at a young age. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a highly skilled and decorated soldier, serving in various conflicts including the Vietnam War. He was eventually recruited into the special operations unit, FOX, and became one of their top operatives.
        <br><br>
        In 1972, Big Boss served as the test subject for the secret government project "Les Enfants Terribles," which aimed to create the perfect soldier using his genes. As a result, he had three clones: Solid Snake, Liquid Snake, and Naked Snake. Big Boss went on to have a tumultuous and complicated relationship with his clones, ultimately leading to his death in 1984 at the hands of Solid Snake.
