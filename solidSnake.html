        <div class="snakeDescription">In 1972, David and his twin brother Eli were born as a result of the secret government project "Les Enfants Terribles,"[7] designed to create the perfect soldier, using the genes of the "Greatest Warrior of the 20th Century" Big Boss. The twins were also to serve as an insurance policy for the Patriots, should Big Boss abandon their organization.
            <br><br>
            Using the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer, eight clone embryos were created by inserting Big Boss's DNA into enucleated egg cells, donated by a healthy Japanese woman.[8] By utilizing the Super Baby Method, the embryos were then implanted into the womb of a surrogate mother with six of the babies eventually being aborted to promote growth in the remaining two.
            <br><br>
            The two clones were also modified on the genetic level, with one clone expressing Big Boss's dominant genetic traits and the other expressing Big Boss's recessive traits. Nine months later, the twins were born and would later receive the codenames of Solid Snake and Liquid Snake. Being a somatic cell clone of Big Boss, Solid Snake inherited mitochondrial DNA from the Japanese egg donor of "Les Enfants Terribles," later demonstrating some awareness of this heritage.[9] A third clone was created afterward.</div>
