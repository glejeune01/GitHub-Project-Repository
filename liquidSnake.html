        <br>
        <div class="snakeDescription">Liquid Snake, real name Eli, was a former soldier and special operations agent. He was one of the three clones of the "Greatest Warrior of the 20th Century," Big Boss, along with Solid Snake and Naked Snake.
        <br><br>
        Born in 1972, Eli and his twin brother David were the result of the secret government project "Les Enfants Terribles," designed to create the perfect soldier using the genes of Big Boss. The twins were also intended to serve as insurance for the Patriots should Big Boss abandon their organization.
        <br><br>
        Using somatic cell nuclear transfer, eight clone embryos were created by inserting Big Boss's DNA into enucleated egg cells donated by a healthy Japanese woman. The embryos were then implanted into the womb of a surrogate mother, with six of the babies eventually being aborted to promote growth in the remaining two. The two clones were modified on the genetic level, with one expressing Big Boss's dominant genetic traits and the other expressing Big Boss's recessive traits. Nine months later, the twins were born and would later receive the codenames of Solid Snake and Liquid Snake. Eli was the clone that expressed Big Boss's dominant genetic traits and was given the codename Liquid Snake. A third clone was created afterward.
